### üí° Idea
  Imagine that you have the black box that can give you an ```Any``` object.   
  You don't know what's already in the box and [what happens inside.](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming))   
      
  Ask for object that you need with |

```bash
|{ (result: Object) in
            
}
```
```bash
ingredients | { (result: Object) in
            
}
```
```bash
ingredients | .one { (t: T) in
            
} | .every { (u: U) in

} | .while { (v: V) in
  true
}
```

### ü™Ñ –°oncept

Add one sign to anything and retreive the result üì¶
